# Machine Learning for Biologists

This repository contains a collection of assignments and projects for a Machine Learning for Biologists class. The goal of this repository is to showcase my work and demonstrate my ability to apply machine learning concepts to biological problems.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `reports/`: This folder contains all of the written reports and assignments for the class.
- `src/`: This folder contains all of the R scripts used for the assignments and projects.
- `renv/`: This folder contains the renv environment for this project, which ensures that the code is reproducible.

## Reproducibility

To reproduce the results in this repository, you will need to have R and the `renv` package installed. Once you have cloned the repository, you can restore the renv environment by running the following command in your R console:

```R
renv::restore()
```

This will install all of the necessary packages for this project. You can then run the R scripts in the `src/` folder to reproduce the results.
